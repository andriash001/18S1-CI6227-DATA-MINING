# 18S1-CI6227-DATA-MINING
- This code implements catboost algorithm.
- We need to train the algorithm using catboost algorithm, then we need to specify the train/test portion and justify our choice 
- Test the trained model on test set then
    a- measure accuracy 
    b- how changing model parameters affect the output
    c-change loss function, number of iterations number of epochs and see if this changed the results
    d- measure the feature importance as value between o-1 for every feature 
- finally we need to write final report exclusive of the code, and explain every thing we had done. It worthnoting that, Lecturer of the   course emphasized that you need justify every choice you had done and try to add every possible reference you emplyed in work
